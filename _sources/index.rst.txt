Welcome to some_module's documentation!
=======================================

I made this little project so people could easily fork, update the name and author,
enable a few web hooks, and have a project which had well defined testing, documentation,
code linting and more.

Now I have added a file :code:`api.rst` to put the API in (ie the docstring from our code).
I include it in the Sphinx build by simply adding it to the contents directly below.
